        "Okay, so I have this problem where there's a segment AB of fixed length 3, and the endpoints A and B are moving on the parabola y² = x. I need to find the shortest distance from the midpoint M of segment AB to the y-axis. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the parabola y² = x is a standard right-opening parabola with vertex at the origin. So any point on this parabola can be represented as (t², t) for some parameter t. That might come in handy because if A and B are moving on this parabola, I can assign coordinates to them using parameters.\n\nLet me denote point A as (a², a) and point B as (b², b), where a and b are real numbers. So, the coordinates of A and B are (a², a) and (b², b) respectively.\n\n",

It's a right-opening parabola with vertex at the origin. The points on this parabola can be represented as (t², t) where t is a parameter. So, maybe I can let point A be (a², a) and point B be (b², b), where a and b are real numbers.\n\nGiven that AB has a fixed length of 3, I can use the distance formula between points A and B. The distance between A(a², a) and B(b², b) is sqrt[(b² - a²)",
        "Okay, so I need to find the shortest distance from the midpoint M of segment AB to the y-axis. The segment AB has a fixed length of 3, and both endpoints A and B are moving on the parabola y² = x. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. We have a parabola y² = x, which opens to the right. Points A and B are moving along this parabola, and the distance between them is always 3 units. The midpoint M of AB will have coordinates that are the average of the coordinates of A and B. Since we need the distance from M to the y-axis, that should just be the x-coordinate of M, right? Because the distance from a point (x, y) to the y-axis is |x|.\n\nSo, my goal is to minimize the x-coordinate of M. To do that, I need to express the coordinates of M in",
